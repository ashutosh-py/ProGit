=== Git in Atom

(((Atom)))
Atom ships with a built-in package called GitHub, which provides a fairly-complete interface to Git operations and a deep integration with the website GitHub.
There are different ways to access the package, probably the most common way is through the keybinding:

Open the Git panel: `Ctrl+9`

Another way is from the menu: `Packages -> GitHub -> Toggle Git Tab`

GitHub comes with plenty of documentation when it comes to the integration with a remote repository on GitHub, which you can find within atom "Flight Manual".
But the GitHub package can also integrate with any remote repository.

=== Clone repositories

To clone a repository, access the command palette by typing `Ctrl + Alt + P` and then run the `GitHub: Clone` command.
In the dialog paste a URL of a repository and click "Clone". A new project will get added to the Tree View.
The URL to the remote repository for SSH connection should be of the form:

    ssh://git@sub.domain.com:portNB/path/project.git

For this operation to succeed, make sure that your git and your ssh are properly configured.
Git is configured from a file called `.gitconfig` which must be located in your user directory (`%USERPROFILE%` on windows, run `git config` on Linux environments). Similarly SSH must be configured in a file `/.ssh/config` also located within your user directory on windows environement.
