=== Organizations

(((GitHub, organizations)))
In addition to single-user accounts, GitHub has what are called Organizations.
Organizational accounts have a namespace where projects exist, but most other things are different.
These accounts represent a group of people with shared ownership of projects, and they provide tools to manage subgroups of those people.

An organization is pretty easy to create; just click on the "`+`" icon at the top-right of any GitHub page, and select "`New organization`" from the menu.

.The "`New organization`" menu item.

Follow the steps and you'll soon be the owner of a brand-new organization.
As an owner, when you fork a repository, you'll have the choice of forking it to your organization's namespace, and you automatically "`watch`" any new repository created under that organization.

==== Teams

Organizations are associated with individual people by way of teams, which are simply a set of individual user accounts.
The power of teams comes with how they tie into other GitHub features.

Organizations don't grant access to their repositories to _users_, they grant it to _teams_.
For example, say your company has three repositories: `frontend`, `backend`, and `deployscripts`.
You'd want your HTML/CSS/Javascript developers to have access to `frontend` and maybe `backend`, and your ops people to have access to `backend` and `deployscripts`.
Teams make this easy, without having to tweak the settings for every single user.

But that's not all teams are good for.
Team `@mentions` (such as `@acmecorp/frontend`) work much the same as they do with individual users, except that *all* members of the team are then subscribed to the thread.
This is useful if you want the attention from someone on a team, but you don't know exactly who to ask.

A user can belong to any number of teams, so don't limit yourself to only access-control teams.
Special-interest teams like `ux`, `css`, or `refactoring` are useful for certain kinds of questions, and others like `legal` and `colorblind` for an entirely different kind.
